MATLAB files to run 2 loss time series, allowing input correlations in freq distributions. 

All scripts call the main function: InhomTwoPP_mr.m 

run_varyTwin.m -- compares Monte Carlo & theory of cov of loss time series as Twin varies (all params fixed), see Figure 5c

run_varyCinp.m -- compares Monte Carlo & theory of cov of loss time series as input correl (c) varies (all params fixed), see Figure 5d

run_varySevers.m -- compares Monte Carlo & theory of cov of loss time series as SEVERITY DISTR params randomly vary (all params fixed), see Figure 6
