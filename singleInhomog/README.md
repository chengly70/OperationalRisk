Have 5 separate MATLAB scripts for all 5 severity distributions we considered (Gamma, Lognormal, Weibull, GPD, Burr); 

They all call InhomogPoissonP_mr.m (the main function)

run_inhomogPP.m (Gamma severity), run_inhomogPP1.m (Lognormal), run_inhomogPP2.m (Weibull), run_inhomogPP3.m (GPD), run_inhomogPP4.m (Burr)
